# covid19-coding
Initially, just a place to capture (via Issues) ideas about OpenMaine coding projects related to COVID-19

Please join our Slack channel, #p-covid19. (Please go to openmaine.org to find a link
to join our Slack, plus more information about OpenMaine.)



E.g., Fork this and create a Maine version? https://codeforphilly.org/blog/call_to_action_-_chime ... or just contribute to that effort?
